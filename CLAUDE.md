# CLAUDE.md - LLM Context and Documentation Guide

## Purpose
This file serves as the central navigation point for LLMs working on this Payload CMS AWS self-hosting project. All documentation should be maintained and kept up-to-date by LLMs during development.

## Important Instructions for LLMs

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Always update documentation** when making changes to the codebase
- **Add new documentation** when implementing new features or deployment strategies
- **Keep all links in this file current** - if you create or rename docs, update the links here
- **Use clear, LLM-friendly formatting** with explicit examples and context

### Project Overview
This repository contains a Payload CMS implementation designed for self-hosting on AWS. Payload CMS is embedded within a Next.js application and they deploy together as a single unit.

**Repository**: https://github.com/focusreactive/payload-aws-selfhosted

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- [`/docs/01-payload-architecture.md`](./docs/01-payload-architecture.md) - Explains how Payload CMS integrates with Next.js
- [`/docs/02-deployment-overview.md`](./docs/02-deployment-overview.md) - General deployment strategies and Payload Cloud comparison
- [`/docs/03-aws-deployment-options.md`](./docs/03-aws-deployment-options.md) - Specific AWS deployment methods and configurations

### Implementation Plans
- [`/docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md`](./docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md) - Original implementation plan with current status update
  - **IMPORTANT**: This file contains current AWS resources already deployed (EC2, RDS, S3)
  - **SSH Access**: Instructions for connecting to the EC2 instance are included
  - **Status**: Updated with completion status and current issues

### Complete Deployment Documentation
- [`/docs/05-complete-deployment-guide.md`](./docs/05-complete-deployment-guide.md) - **NEW: Comprehensive deployment guide**
  - **LLM-Ready**: Complete step-by-step instructions for automated deployment
  - **Troubleshooting**: All issues encountered and their solutions documented
  - **Production-Ready**: Covers security, SSL configuration, IAM roles, and best practices
  - **Current Status**: Deployment 95% complete, minor connectivity issue remaining

### Additional Documentation (Future)
- `/docs/environment-setup.md` - Environment variables and configuration (covered in guide above)
- `/docs/database-setup.md` - PostgreSQL configuration for AWS RDS (covered in guide above)
- `/docs/file-storage-setup.md` - S3 configuration for media uploads (covered in guide above)
- `/docs/docker-deployment.md` - Container deployment instructions
- `/docs/monitoring-and-logs.md` - CloudWatch and monitoring setup

## Quick Reference

### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js with Payload CMS 3.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via `@payloadcms/db-postgres`)
- **Container**: Docker (Dockerfile already configured)
- **Target Platform**: AWS

### Current AWS Infrastructure
**IMPORTANT**: The following AWS resources are deployed and configured:
- **EC2 Instance**: `i-050cf5824f2b89881` (Payload CMS) in eu-north-1
  - **Status**: âœ… Running with Node.js 20, PM2, Nginx configured
  - **Public IP**: 16.16.186.128
  - **Services**: PM2 process manager, Nginx reverse proxy
- **RDS Database**: `payload-cms-db` (PostgreSQL db.t4g.micro)
  - **Status**: âœ… Available with schema created and migrations completed
  - **Password**: Stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
- **S3 Bucket**: `payload-cms-assets-000`
  - **Status**: âœ… Configured with IAM role access (no access keys needed)
- **IAM Resources**: PayloadCMSS3Role, PayloadCMSS3Policy, PayloadCMSS3Profile
  - **Status**: âœ… Configured for secure EC2-to-S3 access
- **SSH Access**: Available via `~/.ssh/Payload CMS.pem`

**ðŸš¨ CURRENT ISSUE**: Application deployed but HTTP connectivity issue prevents web access. See troubleshooting section in complete deployment guide.

For detailed AWS resource information and SSH instructions, see [`/docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md`](./docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md)

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Database migrations
pnpm payload migrate:create
pnpm payload migrate
```

### Critical Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URI` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - Security secret for Payload
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` - Public URL of the application
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - For blob storage (if using Vercel Blob)

## Maintenance Checklist for LLMs

When working on this project, ensure you:
1. âœ“ Update relevant documentation after code changes
2. âœ“ Add new docs for new features or configurations
3. âœ“ Update this CLAUDE.md file with new documentation links
4. âœ“ Include examples and context in all documentation
5. âœ“ Test all commands and configurations before documenting
6. âœ“ Keep documentation focused on practical implementation

## Notes for Future LLMs
- This project uses PostgreSQL, not MongoDB (docker-compose.yml needs updating)
- The Dockerfile is already configured for production builds
- Focus on AWS-specific configurations and best practices
- Always consider security implications in deployment strategies
