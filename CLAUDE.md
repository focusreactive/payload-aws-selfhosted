# CLAUDE.md - LLM Context and Documentation Guide

## Purpose
This file serves as the central navigation point for LLMs working on this Payload CMS AWS self-hosting project. All documentation should be maintained and kept up-to-date by LLMs during development.

## Important Instructions for LLMs

### üö® MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION AND CODE MANAGEMENT
- **ALWAYS commit code changes immediately** after making modifications on the server
- **ALWAYS update documentation** when making changes to the codebase or solving issues
- **NEVER skip the commit step** - all server changes must be reflected in the repository
- **Add new documentation** when implementing new features or deployment strategies
- **Keep all links in this file current** - if you create or rename docs, update the links here
- **Use clear, LLM-friendly formatting** with explicit examples and context

### üìã Required Steps After Every Action:
1. **Make necessary changes** on the server or locally
2. **Update/create documentation** reflecting the changes and lessons learned
3. **Commit and push changes** to the repository immediately
4. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** if documentation structure changes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: Future LLMs must follow this pattern to maintain consistency and prevent loss of important fixes and configurations.

### Project Overview
This repository contains a Payload CMS implementation designed for self-hosting on AWS. Payload CMS is embedded within a Next.js application and they deploy together as a single unit.

**Repository**: https://github.com/focusreactive/payload-aws-selfhosted

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- [`/docs/01-payload-architecture.md`](./docs/01-payload-architecture.md) - Explains how Payload CMS integrates with Next.js
- [`/docs/02-deployment-overview.md`](./docs/02-deployment-overview.md) - General deployment strategies and Payload Cloud comparison
- [`/docs/03-aws-deployment-options.md`](./docs/03-aws-deployment-options.md) - Specific AWS deployment methods and configurations

### Implementation Plans
- [`/docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md`](./docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md) - Original implementation plan with current status update
  - **IMPORTANT**: This file contains current AWS resources already deployed (EC2, RDS, S3)
  - **SSH Access**: Instructions for connecting to the EC2 instance are included
  - **Status**: Updated with completion status and current issues

### Complete Deployment Documentation
- [`/docs/05-complete-deployment-guide.md`](./docs/05-complete-deployment-guide.md) - **NEW: Comprehensive deployment guide**

  - **Public IP**: [Check AWS Console for current IP]
  - **Services**: PM2 process manager, Nginx reverse proxy
  - **Access**: **LIVE** at http://[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]/
- **RDS Database**: `payload-cms-db` (PostgreSQL db.t4g.micro)
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Available with schema created and migrations completed
  - **Password**: Stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
  - **SSL**: ‚úÖ Configured and operational
- **S3 Bucket**: `payload-cms-assets-000`
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Configured with IAM role access (no access keys needed)
- **IAM Resources**: PayloadCMSS3Role, PayloadCMSS3Policy, PayloadCMSS3Profile
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Configured for secure EC2-to-S3 access
- **SSH Access**: Available via `~/.ssh/Payload CMS.pem`

**üåê LIVE DEPLOYMENT**: Payload CMS successfully deployed and accessible at:
- **Homepage**: http://[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]/
- **Admin Panel**: http://[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]/admin
- **API**: http://[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]/api/*

For detailed AWS resource information and SSH instructions, see [`/docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md`](./docs/04-aws-ec2-implementation-plan.md)

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Database migrations
pnpm payload migrate:create
pnpm payload migrate
```

### Critical Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URI` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - Security secret for Payload
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` - Public URL of the application
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - For blob storage (if using Vercel Blob)

## üö® MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL LLMs

**CRITICAL**: After every action that modifies code or configuration, you MUST:
1. **‚úÖ Update documentation** - Document all changes, issues encountered, and solutions
2. **‚úÖ Commit code changes** - Create git commit with descriptive message and push to repository
3. **‚úÖ Update CLAUDE.md** - Add new documentation links and update status

**Failure to follow these steps will result in lost work and deployment inconsistencies.**

## Maintenance Checklist for LLMs

When working on this project, ensure you:
1. ‚úì Update relevant documentation after code changes
2. ‚úì Add new docs for new features or configurations
3. ‚úì Update this CLAUDE.md file with new documentation links
4. ‚úì Include examples and context in all documentation
5. ‚úì Test all commands and configurations before documenting
6. ‚úì Keep documentation focused on practical implementation
7. ‚úì **IMMEDIATELY commit and push after any code/config changes**

## üéâ DEPLOYMENT STATUS: COMPLETE

**Final Status**: Payload CMS has been successfully deployed to AWS and is fully operational.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Full AWS infrastructure deployed (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM)
- ‚úÖ Secure configuration with IAM roles (no hardcoded credentials)
- ‚úÖ SSL connectivity resolved for PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ PM2 process management configured for persistence
- ‚úÖ Nginx reverse proxy with security headers
- ‚úÖ All critical connectivity issues resolved

**Critical Lessons Learned for Future LLMs**:
1. **SSL Configuration**: Always configure SSL in payload.config.ts, not connection strings
2. **Security Groups**: Ensure outbound internet access for package installation
3. **IAM Roles**: Use instance profiles instead of access keys for S3 access
4. **PM2 Configuration**: Use .cjs extension for config files to avoid ES module issues
5. **Environment Variables**: NODE_ENV=production requires careful SSL handling

## Notes for Future LLMs
- This project uses PostgreSQL, not MongoDB (docker-compose.yml needs updating)
- The Dockerfile is already configured for production builds
- Focus on AWS-specific configurations and best practices
- Always consider security implications in deployment strategies
- **IMPORTANT**: Documentation must be updated after each significant step or completion
